# ✅ Future Upgrades for PathSix CRM (Updated)

The ability for admins to assign a lead and then assign a follow up and see the results of that followup OR if it goes past due. 

⚠️ Optional: Hook up token from useAuth() in Projects.tsx like the other pages, so you can stop hardcoding the token string.

Update how projects show on the client/lead detail pages

Refactor projects to use status: "pending" | "won" | "lost" dropdown logic

Add project filtering per lead or client in the /api/projects/ route

🧩 Core Features
Add Projects with status (Won/Lost/Pending)

Add Accounts tied to clients

📊 Reporting & Analytics
Overdue follow-up summary

Activity history by rep or lead

Monthly or weekly stats

🔔 Productivity
Daily/weekly email reminder system

Tasks or to-dos tied to clients/leads

Note pinning or tagging

🧭 UI Improvements
Search or filtering in client/lead lists

Sortable tables (e.g., most recent first)

Dashboard with quick stats


Role-based access controls (your backend supports roles but they aren’t enforced or editable via UI yet).

Account management (like the Project section but for Account records per client).

Recurring follow-ups or reminders with notifications.

Activity log or audit trail of who did what and when.

Email or SMS integration for follow-up reminders or outreach.

Export to CSV/PDF for clients, leads, or interactions.

Advanced filtering/search/sorting on the frontend lists.

Multi-tenant user/role management from the frontend (admin panels).

Dashboard metrics (conversion rate, total deals won/lost, average deal size, etc.).



- [ ] Hook into 404 page and log unknown routes to database once backend is ready  
        // Example future code to log 404s:
        // fetch("/api/log-404", { method: "POST", body: JSON.stringify({ path: window.location.pathname }), headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" } }).catch((error) => { console.error("Failed to log 404:", error); });
        // for Quart:
        //@app.route("/api/log-404", methods=["POST"])
        //    async def log_404():
        //        data = await request.get_json()
        //        path = data.get("path")
        //        # Save `path` to your database
        //        return jsonify({"message": "Logged"}), 200  
- [x] Replace fake isLoggedIn check with real login/auth flow  
- [x] Protect API calls with token authentication (after login)  
- [ ] Add basic error boundaries for React app  
- [ ] Set logic to prevent duplicate entries into DB by multiple users  
    - Tip: Add database UNIQUE constraints (e.g., company name or email)  
    - Tip: Check for existence before inserting  
    - Tip: Disable submit button during API call  
    - Tip: Use toast to inform user  
- [ ] Confirm auto-increment IDs are properly handled by the database  
- [ ] Store 404s with extra info like timestamp, IP, or user agent  
- [x] Do NOT show IDs externally — use company names, not numeric ranking  
- [ ] Add `client_id` (tenant ID) to all main database tables (customers, projects, invoices, etc.)  
- [ ] Add `client_id` to all users (each user belongs to one company/client)  
- [ ] On all API queries, always filter by `client_id` to prevent cross-tenant data access  
- [ ] Prevent exposing raw internal IDs — use public UUIDs or safe keys  
- [ ] Verify on every create/update/delete API call that the user’s `client_id` matches the record’s  
- [ ] Ensure frontend navigation does not allow switching between clients  
- [ ] Future: Add admin/superadmin roles that can cross client boundaries  
- [ ] Future: Log all unauthorized access attempts for security audits  
- [ ] Future: Add cleanup routines for deleting all data tied to a `client_id` (or soft delete)

 Option B — Multiple Notes (Recommended for a CRM)
Each note is its own object:

ts
Copy
Edit
{
  id,
  client_id,
  content,
  created_at,
  created_by
}
Pros:

Looks and feels like Interactions: multiple cards

Allows timestamps, authorship, sorting

Supports future features (pin note, search notes, filter notes)

Cons:

Requires a new ClientNote model in the backend

Adds complexity to both DB and API

Great question — the dashboard is your mission control. It should surface the most important insights at a glance. For a CRM like yours, here’s what a clean, useful dashboard might include:

🔁 Follow-Up Summary (Top Row)
Overdue Follow-Ups (e.g., red count badge — click to view list)

Today's Follow-Ups

Upcoming (Next 7 Days)

📈 Lead & Client Metrics
New Leads This Month

New Clients This Month

Lead → Client Conversion Rate

Deals Won / Lost (Projects by status, e.g. won/lost/pending)

💰 Revenue Metrics (if you're tracking project worth)
Total Project Value (This Quarter)

Average Project Value

Top 3 Clients by Value

📋 Recent Activity Feed
"You added an interaction with John Smith (Client)"

"Converted lead Sarah W. to client"

"Created new project: Website Redesign"

📅 Mini Calendar / Upcoming Interactions
Next 3 follow-ups or appointments with names, times, and a CTA to view

🧭 Optional Widgets
Quick Add Buttons for Lead, Client, Interaction

Team Summary (if you scale to multiple users/roles)

System Messages / Alerts

The key is to show just enough to orient the user and prompt useful actions.

Would you like to start implementing this piece-by-piece, maybe with the follow-up summary cards and a recent activity list first?


 Good Default Uses for Settings.tsx
🔐 Account Security
 Change Password (already implemented)

 Enable 2FA (later)

👤 User Profile
 Change display name

 Update email (with re-verification)

 Upload/change profile picture (if applicable)

🔔 Notifications
 Toggle notification emails (e.g., reminders, assignments)

 Set preferred notification channels (email/SMS)

🏷️ Preferences
 Set default dashboard view (e.g. clients vs leads)

 Theme switcher (light/dark mode toggle)

 Language or timezone preferences

🧑‍💼 Admin-Specific (only shown for admins)
 Manage system-wide settings (like roles or API tokens)

 Manage billing and subscriptions (if you ever make it paid)
 

✨ Optional Improvements for ForgotPasswordPage.tsx
  If you want to polish a bit:

  Add a loading state to disable the button while submitting (prevents double clicks).

  Normalize error messages in case the backend returns HTML or unexpected formats.

  Replace <a href="/login"> with <Link to="/login"> from react-router-dom for SPA routing.


Reports page to-dos: 
If/when you're ready to:

Add user-based breakdowns

Compare periods (e.g. this month vs last)

Export as CSV or PDF

We can build that straight onto this solid foundation.


COMPONENTS:
Take LeadDetailPage and ClientDetailPage and extract reusable components.



We started putting more validation stuff in the backend by creating constants.py and pushing that throughout the backend. Continue with

✅ To Use Backend TYPE_OPTIONS Properly
1. Validate type in all POST/PUT routes
In both create_client(), update_client(), create_lead(), and update_lead():

python
Copy
Edit
from app.constants import TYPE_OPTIONS

# Example
type_value = data.get("type", "None")
if type_value not in TYPE_OPTIONS:
    return jsonify({"error": "Invalid type"}), 400
2. Add type to JSON responses
In your response objects, make sure type is returned:

python
Copy
Edit
"type": client.type,
This applies to:

/clients/

/clients/<id>

/leads/

/leads/<id>

/clients/all

/leads/all

3. (Optional) Add /api/constants/type-options route
Create a new route in something like routes/constants.py:

python
Copy
Edit
from quart import Blueprint, jsonify
from app.constants import TYPE_OPTIONS

constants_bp = Blueprint("constants", __name__, url_prefix="/api/constants")

@constants_bp.route("/type-options", methods=["GET"])
async def get_type_options():
    return jsonify(TYPE_OPTIONS)
Then don’t forget to register the blueprint in app/routes/__init__.py:

python
Copy
Edit
from .constants import constants_bp
app.register_blueprint(constants_bp)
4. (Optional) Load dropdowns dynamically in React
Replace the hardcoded list in CompanyForm.tsx with a fetch:

tsx
Copy
Edit
useEffect(() => {
  fetch("/api/constants/type-options")
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then(setTypeOptions)
    .catch(() => setTypeOptions(["None"]));
}, []);
Then render the dropdown with that list.

✅ Bonus: Add test coverage
Add unit tests or Postman tests that:

Try posting invalid types (expect 400)

Try posting valid types (expect 201)

Confirm type is returned in API responses

Remember in Leads.tsx you have the option to add filters for "temperature" and "Source" to add spice to the leads.
